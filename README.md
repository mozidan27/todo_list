# TODo App Flutter, Hive & Firebase

A feature-rich To-Do application built with Flutter, focusing on clean code, scalability, and real-world architecture. The app integrates Firebase Authentication to support secure login, signup, and password recovery, along with Firebase Cloud services for seamless backend integration.

State management is handled using Cubit, and the project follows the Clean Architecture pattern to ensure a well-structured, maintainable, and reusable codebase.

For local data persistence, Hive is used alongside SharedPreferences to manage onboarding flow, caching, and lightweight storage. Dependency Injection is implemented to improve testability and separation of concerns.

The app also includes profile customization features using Image Picker and Image Cropper, allowing users to select and crop their profile images smoothly.

Local storage with Hive & SharedPreferences

Dependency Injection

Profile image selection & cropping

Scalable, maintainable, and reusable codebase
